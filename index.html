            <p cl></p>
            <p class="text">To Start off, the defendant was Troy Leon Gregg and the plaintiff was the state of Georgia. The Defendant Gregg appealed the court decision of a death penalty. This penalty was obtained due to murder, armed robbery,etc. Gregg felt that the death penalty (cruel and unusual punishment)  was too harsh and violated his 14th and 8th Amendment rights. In the end, the Supreme Court's ruling was that it was a fair punishment as the defendant committed atrocious acts willingly.

            <p class="heading">Constitutional Question</p>
            <p class="text">Next, after he was given his sentence by the Supreme Court of georgia, he appealed to the Supreme Court of the U.S that his 8th and 14th Amendments were being violated. In response, Supreme Court decided to listen to Gregg's appeal as they wanted to save the Death Penalty and explain why the punishment was needed. Finally, the case brought upon a controversial question, "Does the Death Penalty violate the 14th and 8th Amendments?".

            <p class="heading">Significance</p>
            <p class="text">The Gregg v. Georgia  significance led to the decision that the Death penalty was completely constitutional and did not violate the 8th and 14th Amendment. This made the penalty legal in almost all the states in the U.S. The 8th Amendment has to be flexible and moved in a way to stick with modern standards. The accused characters also plays a major role in the endgame of the case as well. To conclude, the case was fairly settled as Gregg committed horrific murders and was given rightful punishment as decided by the court.
